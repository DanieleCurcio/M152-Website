00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000 
- Hello everyone, I'm playing Wow and I'm trying today

2
00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:10.000 
- to complete the flight course on gold speed

3
00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:14.000 
- and namely you have the possibility to complete several flight courses.

4
00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:20.000 
- They are like a time race and I'm trying to complete the advanced one.

5
00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:25.000 
- We have a few skills at our disposal so that I can influence the flying,

6
00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:31.000 
- but I don't really need much of that, really just my Q and the space bar.

7
00:00:34.000  --> 00:00:38.000 
- The purple or blue balls, I don't really see it unfortunately,

8
00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.000 
- they make me slow down when I fly in.

9
00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:44.000 
- That is, I want to prevent that actually

10
00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:49.000 
- and the small bright balls here, they give me a boost.

11
00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:54.000 
- to use the abilities, that I accelerate or fly faster.

12
00:01:13.000  --> 00:01:16.000 
- It's really quite simple how this works.

13
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000 
- That looks good.

14
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.000 
- Only silver, too bad, but that's about it, so close.
